# 42002 - Modelling and Analysis of Sustainable Energy Systems using Operations Research
This repository is intended for the group assignments of the course '42002 - Modelling and Analysis of Sustainable Energy Systems using Operations Research' at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). It contains the GAMS scripts and data for the individual assignment and the final project.

# GAMS
Both projects are coded in [GAMS](https://www.gams.com/)

## Individual Assignment
The individual assignment aimed to create and solve both a MIP (Mixed-Integer Program) and PIP (Pure-Integer Program) using the *branch-and-bound* technique. Both problems are inspired by an electric vehicle charging problem.

## Final Project
The final project aimed to create a model in order to identify the optimal technology mix, according to the cost minimization function, in a 'hypothetical' energy system of the regions of North and South Carolina in the USA based on real data. The competitiveness of different energy technologies is evaluated considering investment costs and production costs, such as the ones related to fuel and emission prices.

# Authors
The individual assignment was coded by me and the final project was also mainly coded by me but the data-gathering and report-creation were executed as a group (Sigurd Indrehus, Lorenzo Mininni, and Ajinkya Pradip Mahale).
